A meteorite is a solid piece of debris that falls into the Earth’s atmosphere and survives to hit the surface.

For the period from 600 bce to 2012 there were more then 34 000 meteorite impacts.

Infographics represents all these cases. The ranges of years are reflected within the color of the markers, when sizes of circles - weight of the meteorites that fell on the Earth.

Meteorites start their way as meteoroids - objects in space that range in size from dust grains to small asteroids. Think of them as “space rocks." When meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere (or that of another planet, like Mars) at high speed and burn up, the fireballs or “shooting stars” are called meteors. And finally, when a meteoroid survives a trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground, it’s called a meteorite. Find this way on the schema in the upper right corner of the work.
